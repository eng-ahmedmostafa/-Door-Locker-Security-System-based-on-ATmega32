# -Door-Locker-Security-System-based-on-ATmega32
Develop a door locker system using two ATmega32 microcontrollers. The HMI_ECU includes a 2x16 LCD and 4x4 keypad for user interaction, while the Control_ECU handles password processing, door control via a DC motor, and an alarm with a buzzer. Passwords are stored in EEPROM. Secure access and alerts on incorrect attempts ensure reliable operation.
